        <h1>The Future of Quantum Computing</h1>
        <p class="intro">Quantum computing is rapidly evolving from a theoretical concept to a tangible technology that could redefine what is possible in computation.</p>

        <h2>1. Breaking the Binary Limits</h2>
        <p>Traditional computers use bits—a stream of electrical or optical pulses representing 1s or 0s. Everything from your tweets and emails to your iTunes songs and YouTube videos is essentially long strings of these binary digits.</p>
        <p>Quantum computers, on the other hand, use qubits, which are typically subatomic particles such as electrons or photons. Generating and managing qubits is a scientific and engineering challenge.</p>

        <h2>2. Quantum Supremacy</h2>
        <p>Google announced in 2019 that it had achieved quantum supremacy with its 53-qubit Sycamore processor. It performed a calculation in 200 seconds that would have taken the world's fastest supercomputer 10,000 years.</p>
        <p>However, IBM disputed this claim, arguing that a classical computer could solve the problem in 2.5 days with enough storage.</p>

        <h2>3. Real-world Applications</h2>
        <p>One of the most promising applications is simulating the behavior of matter down to the molecular level. Auto manufacturers like Volkswagen and Daimler are using quantum computers to simulate the chemical composition of electrical-vehicle batteries to help find new ways to improve their performance.</p>
        <p>Pharmaceutical companies are leveraging them to analyze and compare compounds that could lead to the creation of new drugs.</p>

        <h2>4. The Road Ahead</h2>
        <p>Despite the hype, we are still years away from general-purpose quantum computers. The systems are incredibly sensitive to heat and electromagnetic interference, requiring them to be kept in giant refrigerators at temperatures colder than deep space.</p>
        <p>But as error correction improves and qubit counts rise, the potential to solve problems in seconds that currently take millennia becomes a reality.</p>
